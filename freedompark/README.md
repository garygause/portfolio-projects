# Freedom Park Association

For this project, I developed a website for the [Freedom Park Assocation](https://freedomparkassociation.com/), a group that supports and maintains the privately funded Freedom Park on Camano Island.  I also host and maintain the site on an ongoing basis.

Wordpress, HTML, CSS, Git, Apache, Linode.
