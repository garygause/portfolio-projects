# The Powerline Project
Advanced data science, data engineering, hardware and software engineering project.  Powerline brought smart sensor technology to utilities and power line segments on a massive scale with the goal of detecting line failure before it happens in order to prevent forest fires.

In this project, I was responsible for and personally developed all of the Data Architecture, from raw data received from remote cellular devices, to ETL, storage, apis, web apps for visualization, data analysis, and machine learning for classification.  I also developed a Docker based infrastructure, security, monitoring, and alerting of events to support the needs of the utlity industry.  

Listed as Inventor on patents related to powerline sensor technology (2019, 2020).

## Powerline Analytics
# analytics heading

React web app for visualizing smart sensor data placed on powerlines.  Source code fully developed and maintained by me (2020).  Part of the Powerline Project.
