# The Powerline Project
Advanced data science, data engineering, hardware and software engineering project.  Powerline brought smart sensor technology to power line segments on a massive scale with the goal of detecting line failure before it happens in order to prevent forest fires.

In this project, I was responsible for and personally developed all of the Data Architecture, from raw data received from remote cellular devices, to ETL, storage, apis, web apps for visualization as well as a Docker based infrastruture, CI, security, and monitoring.

Listed as Inventor on patents related to powerline sensor technology (2019, 2020).
